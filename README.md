# RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR
- User Experience
The user clicks the red button that says "Generate Password"
The user will then be presented with the following window prompts:

1. "Number of characters for password: 8-128" (User must enter a number between 8-128 which will be the length of the user's password)
    If user selects a number not within that range, the window will prompt user to try again
2. "add numbers?" (User must select OK if user wants numbers to be in password or select Cancel if no numbers should be in password)
3. "add lowercase letters?" (User must select OK if user wants lowercase letters to be in password or select Cancel if no lowercase letters should be in password)
4. "add uppercase letters?" (User must select OK if user wants uppercase letters to be in password or select Cancel if no uppercase letters should be in password)
5. "add symbols?" (User must select OK if user wants symbols to be in password or select Cancel if no symbols should be in password)
    If user does not select OK for any options, the window will prompt user to try again

After user enters a number in the given range & selects ok for AT LEAST 1 prompt between prompts 2 to 5, a password will be generated inside the dotted box.
